## immediate tasks - chores, features, defects

- fix test discovery which is broken when moved markdown into module - check what is needed for moduel setup

## consider limitations

- all blocks must be seperated by 2 newlines
- multiple levels of nesting
  eg this is **bold text with nested _italic_ text**

## future tasks

- write a ?psuedocode? representation of a general approach to markdown -> html parsing
